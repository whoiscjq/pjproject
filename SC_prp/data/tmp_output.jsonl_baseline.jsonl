{"question": "Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company.  Each car sells for $20,000.  He pays 10% tax on the cars and then another $1000 for registration on each of them.  How much does he pay for everything?", "answer": "##Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cars\nThe total cost of the cars is the number of cars multiplied by the cost per car. \n12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000\n\n##Step 2: Calculate the tax on the cars\nMark pays 10% tax on the total cost of the cars. \n10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000\n\n##Step 3: Calculate the registration cost for all the cars\nMark pays $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars. \n12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000\n\n##Step 4: Calculate the total cost, including tax and registration\nAdd the tax, registration cost, and the original cost of the cars to get the total cost. \n$240,000 (original cost) + $24,000 (tax) + $12,000 (registration) = $276,000\n\nThe final answer is: $276,000"}
