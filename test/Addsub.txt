We know that the company used a total of X gallons of paint, and 660 gallons of white paint. We can set up a ratio to represent the amount of blue paint used as a fraction of the total paint used. Let's call the amount of blue paint used B gallons. Then, we can set up the following ratio:\n\n660 gallons of white paint / X gallons of paint = B gallons of blue paint / Total gallons of paint\n\nWe are given that the amount of blue paint used is 6029 gallons, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n660 gallons of white paint / X gallons of paint = 6029 gallons of blue paint / Total gallons of paint\n\nNow we can solve for X by cross-multiplying:\n\n660 gallons of white paint * Total gallons of paint = X gallons of paint * 6029 gallons of blue paint\n\n660 * Total gallons of paint = 6029 * X gallons of paint\n\nDividing both sides by 6029, we get:\n\nTotal gallons of paint / 6029 = X gallons of paint / 6029\n\nSince Total gallons of paint is the sum of white paint and blue paint, we can write:\n\nTotal gallons of paint = 660 gallons of white paint + B gallons of blue paint\n\nSubstituting this into the equation, we have:\n\n660 gallons of white paint + B gallons of blue paint = 6029 * X gallons of paint\n\nSubtracting 660 gallons of white paint from both sides, we get:\n\nB gallons of blue paint = 6029 * X gallons of paint - 660 gallons of white paint\n\nSince we are given that the amount of blue paint used is 6029 gallons, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n6029 gallons of blue paint = 6029 * X gallons of paint - 660 gallons of white paint\n\nAdding 660 gallons of white paint to both sides, we get:\n\n6029 gallons of blue paint + 660 gallons of white paint = 6029 * X gallons of paint\n\n660 gallons of white paint + 660 gallons of white paint = 6029 * X gallons of paint\n\n660 gallons of white paint + 660 gallons of white paint = 6029 * X gallons of paint\n\n660 gallons of white paint + 660 gallons of white paint = 6029 * X gallons of paint\n\n660 gallons of white paint + 660 gallons of white paint = 6029 * X gallons of", "verify_answer": 660, "rectify_reasoning": "The company used a total of 6689 gallons of paint for the houses in Hancock County.

We can do this by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.\n\nThe distance traveled from Earth to Planet X is X light-years. The time taken to travel this distance is not given in the problem, so we can assume it to be the same as the time taken to travel from Planet X to Planet Y.\n\nThe distance traveled from Planet Y back to Earth is 0.1 light-years. Again, the time taken is not given, so we can assume it to be the same as the time taken to travel from Planet Y to Earth.\n\nNow, we can set up the following equation:\n\nRate from Earth to Planet X = Rate from Planet X to Planet Y = Rate from Planet Y to Earth\n\nLet's assume the rate from Earth to Planet X is r1 and the rate from Planet X to Planet Y is r2. Then, the rate from Planet Y to Earth is r3.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that:\n\nr1 = r2 = r3\n\nNow, we can use the rates to find the total distance traveled:\n\nTotal distance = (r1 * t1) + (r2 * t2) + (r3 * t3)\n\nSince we know that the total distance traveled is 0, we can set up the equation:\n\n0 = (r1 * t1) + (r2 * t2) + (r3 * t3)\n\nWe can assume that the time taken to travel from Earth to Planet X and from Planet X to Planet Y is the same, so we can set t1 = t2 = t3. Then, we can simplify the equation:\n\n0 = (r1 * t1) + (r2 * t2) + (r3 * t3)\n\n0 = (r1 * t1) + (r2 * t2) + (r3 * t3)\n\nSince we don't have the specific values for r1, r2, and r3, we cannot determine the exact value of X or the unknown variable.

Then we can write the equation:\n\nX = 41 + Y\n\nWe are given that the number of books she bought at the yard sale is 46, so we can substitute Y with 46 in the equation:\n\nX = 41 + 46\n\nNow we can solve for X:\n\nX = 87\n\nThe value of X is 87.\n", "verify_answer": 87}, "final_answer": 46}
